Dependencies:
=============

Compiler & toolsets - installed system-wide:
---------------------------------------------
1.    VisualStudio 2019 Community edition:
The C compiler identification is MSVC 19.29.30133.0
The CXX compiler identification is MSVC 19.29.30133.0
Windows-10.0.19043

2. CMake
From https://cmake.org/download/ download
cmake-3.22.1-windows-x86_64.msi and install; check (select) the following:
    * for all users
    * add cmake on PATH for all users

3. git and gitk; optionally gh cli (from github)

4. WarSetup (github fork)

5. Inno setup



Directories layout - AVOID FUNNY NAMES, USE ONY ALPHANUMERIC CHARACTERS, '_'
(UNDERSCOPRE) AND '-' (DASH) IF NECESSARY; AVOID NAMED BEGINNING WITH DIGITS
================================================================================
1. Install Python3.9 (3.9.7)
    USE the official Python installer from Python.org, NOT the Python app from
    Windows store!

2. Make virtual environment named "scipyenv" on a drive with enough space
(at least 30 GiB, space needed to expand sources and build software)
    2.1 make a "Scripts" folder in your personal folder, add it to PATH
    2.2 inside, copy the scipyact.bat

3. Make directory "scipyen_sdk" ideally on the same drive as "scipyenv" directory

4. Clone scipyen git repo, ideally on the same drive as "scipyenv" directory
    4.1 cd to "scipyen" and clone the branches:
    "master":
        git checkout master
        git pull

    "dev":
        git checkout dev
        git pull

Build scipyen_sdk software libraries
====================================
NOTE: Some toolkits are installed system-wide (VisualStudio, CMake); these will
be used to build scipyen_sdk libraries (i.e. libraries required by scipyen) and
install them in the scipyen_sdk directory.

Libraries will be built and installed in the order of their dependencies; these
dependencies will be expected to be installed in scipyen_sdk; this is so that
these libraries will NOT clobber other library versions installed on the system.

We will then modify scipyact batch file to take those into account.
