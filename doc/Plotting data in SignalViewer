neo.Block:
    • each segment is a "frame"
    
    • for each segment:
        ∘ the signals (analog and irregularly sampled) are plotted
            in their own PlotItem
            ★ to keep it simple, the separateChannelAxis flag is NOT used
                (if you want to plot each channel of a multi-channel signal in 
                 separate PlotItems, then pass the signal to the 
                 SignalViewer.view() and set this flag to True)
             
        ∘ events are all plotted in the same PlotItem (NOTE: they can also be
            overlaid in a signal PlotItem using the `overlayTargets` method)

        ∘ spike trains (contained in the segment's `spiketrains` attribute, which
            is a neo.core.spiketrainlist.SpikeTrainList) are plotted all in the
            same PlotItem (NOTE: they can also be overlaid in a signal PlotItem 
            using the `overlayTargets` method)
            
            
neo.Segment:
    • treated as a segment in the neo.Block
    
    • there is only one "frame"
    
sequence of neo.Segment:
    • treated as a neo.Block
    
    • each segment is a "frame"
    
neo.AnalogSignal, DataSignal, neo.IrregularlySampledSignal, IrregularlySampledDataSignal:
    • plotted in a single PlotItem, UNLESS separateSignalChannels flag is True, in
        which case each channel is plotted in its own PlotItem
        
    • there is only one frame, UNLESS:
        ∘ separateSignalChannels is False, AND
        ∘ frameAxis is 1 (i.e., frameAxis is the same as signalChannelAxis which
            is orthgonal to the data axis)
