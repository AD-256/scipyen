mainWindow.fileSyetemModel.rootPath() -> is the path to the current folder

realrootpath = os.path.realpath(mainWindow.fileSystemModel.rootPath()) -> is the real path to the current folder

    this needs to be broken down to a bread crumb:
        
    1. get the drive (if not on Linux)
    
        drive, realpath = os.path.splitdrive(realrootpath)
        
        if drive is not empty, make a FIRST bread crumb out of it
            assign drive to the label part (bcItem)
            then get the folder names in the drive to the bcButton
            
        now split the realpath
