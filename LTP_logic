parsing neo.Block form Axon files for LTP experiments

data.annotations["protocol"]:
    lRunsPerTrial > 1 => averaged runs
    lEpisodesPerRun > 1 => how many sweeps per run
    
    these can be from a single pathway, or from 
    separate pathways
    
    nAlternateDACOutputState 0 or 1 ?
        if 1, then there are different waveforms
        in the protocol for each sweep (does this only
        applied for two sweeps per run?)
        
        else: same waveforms defined in the protocol
        apply to every sweep
        
        
    nAlternateDigitalOutputState 0 or 1 ?
        is 1, then digital outputs are different
        for each sweep does this also apply to more than two
        sweeps?)
        
        else it is the same digital output for all sweeps
        
        Typical use case: use alternative digital output
        to deliver trigger signals to separate stim electrodes,
        one for each pathway -- hence activate synaptic inputs
        separately (one per sweep)
